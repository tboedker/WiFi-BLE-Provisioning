# Wi-Fi BLE Provisioning

This project is a non-profit tool aiming at helping Hobbiest, Makers, students, software/electronic developers etc. who implements Wi-Fi modules in their projects. The provisioning of a Wi-Fi module when no keyboard/display is available is a pain. 
This project iOS app and embedded source help in cases where BLE is available along with the Wi-Fi.

Wi-Fi provisioning over BLE is one of the most user friendly ways to send Wi-Fi credentials securely to an Wi-Fi device.

Hope it is useful to you :o)

Kind regards 

Thomas
